Description: Parallel Line Assays: Completely randomized design,
 Randomized Block design, and Latin squares design.
 Balanced data are fitted as described in the Ph.Eur.
 In the presence of missing values complete data analysis can be
 performed (with computation of Fieller's confidence intervals for
 the estimated potency), or imputation of values can be applied.
 The package contains a script such that a pdf-document with a
 report of an analysis of an assay can be produced from an input file
 with data of the assay. Here no knowledge of R is needed by the user.
